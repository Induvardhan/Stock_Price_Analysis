A repo for time-series analysis of the stock prices
Stock Market Analysis Using Python
This project demonstrates an interactive approach to stock market analysis using Python. It leverages yfinance for data extraction and Plotly for creating dynamic visualizations, allowing users to explore stock trends effectively.

Key features of this project:

**Candlestick Chart**: Visualizes the price movements of stocks, aiding in better understanding of open, close, high, and low prices.

**Bar Plot**: Provides a simple, clear view of the closing prices over time, making long-term trends easy to analyze.

**Range Slider**: Enhances interactivity by allowing users to select specific time periods for analysis.

**Time Period Selectors**: Lets users filter data by predefined time frames (1 month, 6 months, 1 year, etc.), simplifying historical comparisons.

**Weekend Gaps Removal**: Excludes weekends or holidays from the data to focus only on active trading days.

This project primarily focuses on the stock of Adani Enterprises but can be easily adapted to analyze other stocks. The techniques used here offer a flexible foundation for anyone looking to dive deeper into financial data analysis using Python.

Make sure to use the _Python 3.11_ environment when executing in **Jupyter Notebook**
